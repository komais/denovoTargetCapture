Legend for GRP Mammal dot plots (KMCRowe, 11 Apr. 2012)


There are three groups of mammals with dot plots:

Occupancy Modeled:the core group of mammals that had sufficient data to model detectability and occupancy.
Ancillary species: no detectability estimates for these species.
Additional species:other species found within the transects, but may have unresolved taxonomic issues, are found in only one transect, or other characteristic that limited inference of range shifts.


Only West slope aggregated sites were modeled for detectability.


Figure legend:
Grey closed circle: aggregated survey sites without detectability estimates for that species.
Open circles: aggregated survey sites with detectability estimates for that species. Size of the circle represents the detectability estimate of that species at that site.

Green diamond: species presence detected by quantifiable trapping methods (e.g., sherman, victor, or pitfall trap).
Green plus: species presence detected by non-quantifiable effort (e.g., Macabee traps, shotgun, leg-hold trap, salvage).
Light Blue plus: species presence detected by observation only.
